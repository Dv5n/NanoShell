## Contribute
If you'd like to contribute to NanoShell,
fork the repository, make your changes,
and submit a pull request. If I like the changes,
I will merge them into the main branch.

**This is easy and everyone can do!**
**This project is not that complex!**
**You can keep this project alive!**

You can start by improving something,
adding a new command that is not on the list,
modify existing commands, or even add new plugins,
follow the example plugin `ExamplePlugin.c` located in
`plugins/` or modify it to say something else.

I will do my best to make plugins as simple to create and modify as possible!

If you encounter any errors or questions, open an issue,
and I will try to help you!

You can create issues even for requesting commands or improvements,
I will add the command or improvement to the TODO file.
