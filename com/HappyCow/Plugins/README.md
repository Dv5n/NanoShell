## Plugin development

Fork or download the source code to create your own plugins!
If you'd like your plugin included in the main repository, open a pull request.
If I find it interesting, I will integrate it. Place your plugins in this folder and run them with: `loadplugin com.HappyCow.Plugins.<YourPluginNameHere!>` (Note: Without any file extensions).

**NOTE**: Custom plugins *moved* to [here](https://github.com/Dv5n/NanoShell-Plugins).
