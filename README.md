# NanoShell
Simple Java shell, but with many useful features!

It has 15+ commands including useful commands like: `mkdir`, `rmdir`, `touch`, `cat`, `ping`, and *many* others!

## Running
You can compile it using `make` or `make build` and then `make run` or running the jar file with `java -jar NanoShell.jar`

If there are any error messages, I will be happy to fix it! Just open an issue and I will help you.
